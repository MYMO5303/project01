# Children in Japan are taking their own lives
## Description of what I aimed
What I aimed to accomplish is to clarify and focus on how serious the situation of child suicide in Japan is by using data.
## Description of my findings
The number of child suicides was increasing since 2016 and reached the highest record in 2022.
## Summery of the data collection process
1. Searched and found the suicide statistic data on:
   *  website of [Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare]
(https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/hukushi_kaigo/seikatsuhogo/jisatsu/jisatsu_year.html)
   *  website of [National Police Agency](https://www.npa.go.jp/publications/statistics/safetylife/jisatsu.html)
2. Also found suicide rate of G7 <https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/hukushi_kaigo/seikatsuhogo/jisatsu/sesakugaiyou.html>
3. As the NPA data was all in pdf files, I decided to use the MHLW data in excel files. These are the data used for analysis.


4. I tried to use pandas but the excel files were "Kami-Excel" and not applicable. I ended up picking the numbers manually and made into two excel files.
   * [suicidetotal_Japan_2008-22.xlsx](https://github.com/MYMO5303/project01/files/11858384/suicidetotal_Japan_2008-22.xlsx)
   * [For data suicide_children 2008-2022.xlsx](https://github.com/MYMO5303/project01/files/11858388/For.data.suicide_children.2008-2022.xlsx)
